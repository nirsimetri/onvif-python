| `perf`     | üöÄ Performance improvements                                                  |

### General Guidelines

- **Describe your changes clearly** in the PR description.  
- **Reference related issues** by number (e.g., `Fixes #123`).  
- **Keep changes focused**‚Äîavoid mixing unrelated fixes or features in one PR.  
- **Include tests** for new features or bug fixes when possible.  
- **Follow the style guide** and ensure your code passes linting and tests.  
- **Be responsive to review feedback** and update your PR as needed.  
- **Squash commits** if requested, to keep history clean.  

## Reporting Issues

- Search existing issues before opening a new one to avoid duplicates.
- Provide as much detail as possible: environment, device model, ONVIF version, error messages, and steps to reproduce.
- Attach logs, screenshots, or code snippets if relevant.
- Be polite and constructive‚Äîremember, maintainers and contributors are volunteers.

## Style Guide

- **PEP8** is the standard for Python code style. Use tools like `flake8` and `black` to check and format your code.
- **Docstrings:** Use clear, concise docstrings for modules, classes, and functions.
- **Type hints:** Add type annotations where appropriate for better readability and tooling support.
- **Comments:** Write helpful comments, especially for complex logic.
- **Naming:** Use descriptive variable, function, and class names.

## Documentation

- Update the README if your changes affect usage or installation.
- Add or update docstrings and inline comments.
- If you add new modules or services, document their usage and API.
- For device-specific notes, contribute to the [device-test](https://github.com/nirsimetri/onvif-products/blob/main/device-test) list.

## Community & Support

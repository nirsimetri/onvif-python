## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in ONVIF Python, please report it privately to the repository maintainers using GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature. This helps us address issues quickly and responsibly, minimizing risk to users.

- **Do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly** until they have been reviewed and fixed.
- To report a vulnerability:
  1. Go to the [ONVIF Python GitHub repository](https://github.com/nirsimetri/onvif-python).
  2. Click on the "Security" tab.
  3. Select "Report a vulnerability" and follow the instructions.
- Your report will be sent directly to the maintainers and handled confidentially.
- Please include as much detail as possible: affected versions, steps to reproduce, impact, and suggested mitigation if available.

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will work with you to resolve any issues promptly. Thank you for helping keep ONVIF Python secure!
